This marketing agency wrote software for its marketing platform. The marketing agency needs the code to be 
legible and that fallows accessibility standards for search engine optimization.
In order to to do what it is ask of me, I need to look at the code and the way it was written.
The source code cannot have repeating patters:
        ex: <html> <html> </html>
The example shows a repeating pattern with the extra html tag. 

The source code also has to follow semantic html elements. The structure has to be legible and logical
when viewing the code in the inspector menu on a browser. Most of the time the codes does not need to be changed,
rather, the codes just needs to be clean and legible. 



When viewing the code for the first time, I see the code needs to be refactor. 
When refactoring, it is important to start from the very first line of code for two simple 
reasons:
        1. syntax of the code may need enhancement which could have clues of mal-practices.
        2. Human error
Having said that, refactoring starts on line one. 

In order to make this simple and not a one-hundred page paper, I am going to look at the html source code then the css.

At first glance, all the code looks good. I added comments to separate each section of the source code and added spaces. 
Now looking at the source code, the semantic HTML elements are found with ease. The structure looks a lot cleaner,
and the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. The image elements are easily found.
I put in alt attributes to describe the pictures if the pictures are not compatible with some search engines.
I decided to change the name of "website" to the name of the company. It is standard and in general, good practice 
to name your title after your company or the project you are referencing. This concludes the refactoring of Horiseon.
